 *  Grand Orchid Farmhouse, Raiwind Road, Lahore.
 *
 *  Page order (one full screen each):
 *     1. Opening   — a sealed dusty-blue envelope, "Tap to Open": the wax
 *                    seal cracks, the flap opens, the letter rises and
 *                    grows into the HERO — the names written inside a
 *                    wreath that grows leaf by leaf.
 *     2. Letter    — Bismillah, the invitation, the names and the verse.
 *     3. Countdown — the date under silver scratch-off foil, live countdown.
 *     4. Schedule  — timeline built from `schedule.items`.
 *     5. Story     — a few words from the couple.
 *     6. Venue     — name, address, an illustrated map (tap → Google Maps)
 *                    and "Open in Google Maps".
 *     7. Dress code
 *     8. Q&A       — tap a question to open it.
 *     9. RSVP      — name, guests and a note, "I Will Attend" / "Can't
 *                    Attend". Replies go to the host's own Google Sheet and
 *                    Gmail (set `rsvp.endpoint`; see README → RSVP replies).
 *    10. Dua       — gifts / prayers.
 *    11. Closing   — "In sha Allah".
 *
 *  • Text supports plain strings only (no HTML).
 *  • Media paths are relative to the /site folder.
 *  • Dates with a time use ISO 8601 with Pakistan's UTC offset (+05:00).
 *  • Link previews (WhatsApp etc.) read index.html, not this file: if you
 *    change the names or date, update <title> and the og: tags there too.
